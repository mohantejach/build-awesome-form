## Side Note

- Refer [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) and [WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/) for more information about building a form.
- Feel free to explore Tailwindcss in this task. Customizing and playing with Tailwind is always fun.
- Finally, Always remember - "What we build is, What we use".
